# Assignment 3
Notice that a binary file `exec` has been provided for this exercise. Your task is to figure out what it achieves, and how you can execute it to obtain the output that is desired. 

Namely,
* What the program does
* What the program requires for smooth operation, and how we must provide it
* Elaborate on the sequence of functions the program takes to achieve it's goal

**Hint 1**: Refer to the *Linux II* slides on inspecting executables in Linux
**Hint 2**: `test.dimacs` is a file passed as input to the `exec` program.
